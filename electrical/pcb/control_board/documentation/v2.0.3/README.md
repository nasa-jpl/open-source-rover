# Viewing .svg files

- Most web browsers (well, tested on Chrome) support rendering svg files within the browser. 
    - On MacOS you can just drag and drop the file from File Browser into the web browser to open it. The browser rendered version works pretty well!
- on MacOS you can use Quick Look to get a quick render (press spacebar on the file in the File Browser)
