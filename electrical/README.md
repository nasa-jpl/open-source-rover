## Ordering PCBs

To order these boards we suggest that you order from [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/), this PCB fabrication company is quite inexpensive for this board size and has good turnaround time. Upload the .zip files individually and make sure the following settings are set:

* Layers - 2
* Dimension - 53 x 69 mm (arduino shield) & 175 x 154 mm (roboclaw breakout)
* PCB Qty - 10
* PCB Thickness - 1.6 mm
* PCB Color - Whatever color you want
* Surface Finish - HASL
* Copper Weight - 1oz
* Gold Fingers - No
* Panel by JLPCB - No
* Flying Probe Test - Fully Tested
* Castellated Holes - No
* Different Design - 1

## Creating the wiring

This is a soft prerequisite for assembling some of the mechanical assemblies. If you have wiring ready, you will be able to route the wires through the rover once and for all.

Follow the instructions at [wiring](wiring/README.md)

## Soldering the PCBs

Follow the instructions at [electrical build](electrical_build.md)
